rpi-tvheadend
=============

Turn your RPI has a TV broadcaster for your local network.


Requirement
-----------

 - a Raspberry PI (or a clone working with ARM processor)
 - a working Docker environment
 - a DVB adapter
  - supported by tvheadend 
  - supported by your host linux distribution with correct driver

Limitation
----------
Due to the small raspberry's processor, transcoding is not enabled.
For the same reason, it is best to use a wired network. 
You can try with wifi G / N in a really good condition

Average network usage
---------------------

*On a 100BASE-TX network with 1 client and with a DVB-T adapter*

    TV SD : up to 5Mb
    TV HD : up to 11Mb

Usage
-----

    docker run --name tvheadend -p 9981:9981 -p 9982:9982 -v /my/persistent/directory/tvheadend:/config -v /tmp:/records --privileged romainf/rpi-tvheadend

**/config** is the directory where persistent tvheadend configuration are saved. You probably want persist him.

**/records** is an extra directory for recording video or for timeshifting. I mount it on /tmp who is a tmpfs mount in my host, because of the bad performance of SD cards storage.

If you want to persist video records, you should mount an external HDD.

**Port 9981/tcp** is used for the HTTP interface. Go to http://my-raspberry-pi-ip:9981/ in a web browser to configure it.

**Port 9982/tcp** is used for HTSP stream
